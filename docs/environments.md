## Development Environments
Below you will find information on the component used on the back-end and front-end of the application.  Development environment will operate via your local host on port 3000.

### Back-end System
This will be delivered using Node.js with Express. The database we will use will be a noSQL DBMS called MongoDB.  To create bindings to Node.js application the Mongoose.js package on NPM will be used.
